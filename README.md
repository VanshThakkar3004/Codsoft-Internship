Here are all Files of Internship Work and All Tasks


**Task-1** : Titanic Survival Prediction
Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook used to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. It typically involves data exploration, cleaning, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset. The notebook then applies machine learning models, such as logistic regression or decision trees, to find patterns in the data. Finally, it evaluates the model's performance to determine its accuracy in predicting which passengers survived. 

**Task-2**: Movie Rating Prediction With Python
Movie Rating Prediction with Python is a project that uses machine learning to forecast a movie's rating. It starts by gathering a dataset of movies, including features like genre, director, actors, and budget. The data is then preprocessed and used to train a predictive model, such as a regression algorithm. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict a movie's rating based on its attributes before it is released.

**Task-3**: Iris Flower Classification With Python
Iris Flower Classification with Python is a classic machine learning project that uses a well-known dataset to categorize iris flowers into three species. The dataset contains features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The task involves training a classification model, such as a K-Nearest Neighbors or Support Vector Machine, on this data. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the species of a new iris flower based on its physical measurements.

**Task-4**: Sales Prediction With Python
Sales Prediction with Python is a project that leverages historical data to forecast future sales. It involves using data about past sales, marketing spend, seasonality, and other relevant factors to train a predictive model. Common techniques include time-series forecasting, linear regression, or more advanced machine learning algorithms.

**Task-5**: Credit Card Fraud Detection With Python
Credit Card Fraud Detection with Python is a project focused on identifying fraudulent transactions from a large dataset. It uses machine learning models to analyze transaction features like amount, time, and location. The challenge is often a highly imbalanced dataset, with very few fraudulent transactions, requiring specialized techniques like resampling or anomaly detection. The objective is to build an effective and robust system that can flag suspicious activities in real-time, helping financial institutions prevent financial losses.
